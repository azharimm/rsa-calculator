# rsa-calculator
A simple app to calculate the public key, private key and encrypt decrypt message using the RSA algorithm.

#How to use it
>Step 1. Find two random prime number (more than 100 better)

>Step 2. Choose the value of 1 mod phi

>Step 3. Choose the value of e and d, e (public exponential) and d (private exponential). Those two numbers will be used as the two key to encrypt and decrypt the message

>Step 4. Encrypt and Decrypt your message using the numbers you got from the previous step.
